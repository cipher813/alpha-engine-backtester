"""Single-artifact replay — re-run a captured DecisionArtifact under a
different model and persist a side-by-side comparison.

Pipeline:

  1. Load ``DecisionArtifact`` JSON from S3 by key.
  2. Resolve the canonical Pydantic schema for the ``agent_id`` via
     ``nousergon_lib.agent_schemas.resolve_schema_for_agent``.
     Skips replay for unknown agent families (no schema to validate
     against → no meaningful concordance signal).
  3. Invoke the target model via ``krepis.llm.LLMClient.structured()``
     against the krepis router edge (``resolve_target_spec`` below).
     Extracts the parsed
     Pydantic instance's ``model_dump()`` for the comparison +
     persistence layers. Schema-validation failures surface as
     ``replay_error`` on the artifact — they're the silent-drift signal
     we wanted to expose (target model emits a structurally divergent
     output that the canonical schema rejects).
  4. Persist side-by-side artifact under the canonical eval_artifacts
     layout: ``decision_artifacts/_replay/{run_id}_{original_model}_vs_{target_model}.json``
     (flat, YYMMDDHHMM run_id) + a ``decision_artifacts/_replay/latest.json``
     sidecar. Key format owned by ``nousergon_lib.eval_artifacts``.

**alpha-engine-config-I7878 (2026-08-20): migrated off DIRECT OpenRouter
onto the krepis router edge**, closing the last gap left by Brian's
2026-08-03 ruling that no agent may be directly linked to OpenRouter
(alpha-engine-config-I6367). This module and
``lambda_concordance/handler.py`` were the only live call sites in the
repo that still resolved a provider API key from SSM and constructed a
provider-pinned ``ModelSpec`` themselves; they were invisible
to the fleet guard until ``crucible-backtester`` was first scanned
(alpha-engine-config-I7864).

``target_model`` is now a **registry entry id** from
``alpha-engine-config/private-docs/LLM_MODEL_REGISTRY.yaml`` — e.g.
``"deepseek-v4-flash"`` — not an OpenRouter slug. That is what keeps a
PINNED model inside the router policy: a registry id is a layer-1 fact,
and provider, upstream model string, endpoint, credential and params are
all resolved above this module (``krepis.router.resolve_model_spec``,
krepis-PR172). The registry already models exactly this case — entries
kept ``active`` and out of every group are annotated "callable BY NAME
only" — because a concordance harness must measure a NAMED model: a
capability group would let the fallback chain silently vary the thing
being measured between runs.

**What this did to cross-run comparability — read before comparing a
score across 2026-08-20.** The pre-migration call addressed OpenRouter's
bare ``deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`` slug; the registry's own note on
``deepseek-v4-flash-openrouter-max`` records that OpenRouter keeps that
bare slug on the ORIGINAL snapshot while the DeepSeek first-party API
serves the
2026-07-31 re-post-trained revision under the same bare name. Registry id
``deepseek-v4-flash`` routes to that first-party API. So the target model
genuinely changes weights, and no registry entry reproduces the old call
exactly (``deepseek-v4-flash-openrouter-max`` pins the 0731 slug but at
``reasoning: {effort: max}``). ``agent_cheap_model_concordance`` is
therefore a LEVEL SHIFT at this migration, not a continuous series.
It is not a silent one: the CloudWatch ``target_model`` dimension value
changes from ``deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`` to ``deepseek-v4-flash``, so
the break appears as a new series rather than a step inside the old one.
Re-baseline rather than compare across it (alpha-engine-config-I7878).

**alpha-engine-config-I2997 (2026-07-19): migrated off direct Anthropic
(``langchain_anthropic.ChatAnthropic``) to the fleet-SOTA
``krepis.llm.LLMClient`` transport.** This dropped the "invocation isomorphism
with production agents" rationale the prior ``with_structured_output``
choice was built on (production agents still call Anthropic directly for
now; only THIS cheap-model-concordance measurement arm moved), but keeps
what actually matters for this module's purpose:

  - **Pydantic validation against the captured contract.** Catches the
    silent-drift class where a target model emits a slightly different
    structure that would otherwise wash through the comparison stage
    as an unexplained low concordance score. ``krepis.llm.LLMClient.
    structured()`` validates the SAME way (``schema.model_validate``),
    just over a different transport.
  - **Schema portability.** Schemas live in ``nousergon_lib.agent_schemas``
    (lifted 2026-05-05, lib v0.4.0) so backtester can validate against
    the canonical contract without a heavy cross-repo dep on research.

``ModelSpec.structured_outputs=False`` is REQUIRED, not incidental:
live-verified 2026-07-19 against ``nousergon_lib.agent_schemas.
QuantAnalystOutput`` (one of the six canonical schemas this module
resolves) — the JSON-instruction + tolerant-extraction fallback
(``structured_outputs=False``) round-tripped this schema correctly on
every live attempt via ``deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash``. Strict
``response_format=json_schema`` mode (``structured_outputs=True``) is
NOT used because the sibling alpha-engine-config-I2997 migration
(crucible-research's ``producers/single_agent.py``, same live-testing
session) found it UNRELIABLE for DeepSeek-family models on OpenRouter —
against a structurally similar schema, strict mode intermittently
renamed/dropped a REQUIRED field (e.g. the equivalent of ``ticker`` came
back as ``symbol``/``candidate``), failing schema validation on every
attempt, while the same prompt round-tripped correctly every time under
``structured_outputs=False``. Since this module measures exactly this
class of divergence (concordance/silent-drift), routing the measurement
itself through a transport mode with its OWN independent failure mode
would confound the signal — ``structured_outputs=False`` is the
verified-reliable choice, consistent across every DeepSeek+OpenRouter
call site this migration touched.
``attempts=1`` (no corrective retry) is DELIBERATE, not a missed
optimization: this module's whole purpose is measuring how often the
target model's raw output diverges from the canonical schema — a
corrective retry would suppress exactly the signal
(``agent_cheap_model_concordance``) it exists to produce.
``reasoning`` is no longer set here. It used to be hand-set to
``{"exclude": True}`` so a reasoning-capable model would not burn its
whole output budget on chain-of-thought and return empty content
(config#1659 / config#2575). That is now a REGISTRY fact —
``params.reasoning`` on the entry, which for ``deepseek-v4-flash`` is
exactly ``{exclude: true}``, so the served behaviour is unchanged — and a
second copy of it at the call site is the layer-5 duplication
model-router-policy §2 forbids.

The captured ``input_data_snapshot`` is intentionally NOT re-presented
to the model: the original ``user_prompt`` already contained the
relevant slice of the snapshot inlined (research's typed-state arc
canonicalized this — every agent's ``user_prompt`` is the load-bearing
input surface). Replay-time RAG re-execution would require the original
RAG corpus + ArcticDB + tools to be available, which is out of scope for
v1 (single-shot replay). When deeper replay is needed (full ReAct loop
with tool re-execution), wrap this module rather than fork it.

Cost attribution: every replay invocation records token counts +
derived cost in the persisted artifact's ``replay_cost`` block. The
existing cost telemetry pipeline (closed 2026-05-01) does NOT
auto-ingest replay calls — replay is offline analysis, not a
production run. To roll up replay spend, post-process the
``decision_artifacts/_replay/`` prefix.

    That is a real loss of one observability field, and it is the right trade:
    config#3006 wanted this for a jurisdiction/compliance check, and the
    routed path answers that question at a better place — the registry's
    ``upstream_host`` for the addressed entry, plus the router edge's own
    per-request telemetry — rather than by trusting a field the response
    happens to carry. A pinned entry has no chain, so which upstream served it
    is a registry fact, not a discovery."""

            ``"deepseek-v4-flash"``) from
            ``alpha-engine-config/private-docs/LLM_MODEL_REGISTRY.yaml``.
            NOT a provider slug: ``"deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash"`` is an
            OpenRouter slug and is refused by the router with the
            addressable ids named (alpha-engine-config-I7878).
        bucket: S3 bucket; defaults to ``alpha-engine-research``.
        replay_prefix: S3 prefix for the replay output; defaults to
            ``decision_artifacts/_replay``.
        max_tokens: explicit max_tokens for the target call; defaults
            to ``DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS``.
        s3_client: injected for tests.
        client_factory: krepis.llm.LLMClient test seam — a callable
            ``(spec, api_key) -> transport_client`` exposing
            ``chat.completions.create``. Production leaves it unset.
        model_spec: a ``ModelSpec`` already resolved by
            ``resolve_target_spec`` — batch runs resolve once per target
            model and pass it down. None resolves for this one call.
        persist: when False, returns the ``ReplayOutput`` without
            writing it to S3. Used by batch mode + tests.

    Returns:
        ``ReplayOutput`` populated with original + replay sides + per-
        agent comparison block.

    Schema resolution:
        Looks up the canonical Pydantic schema for the captured
        ``agent_id`` via ``nousergon_lib.agent_schemas.
        resolve_schema_for_agent``. Agents without a registered schema
        (or unknown families) are skipped — replay only runs against
        the 6 canonical agent types whose contracts live in the lib.
        This is intentional: replay-as-concordance-signal is meaningful
        only when the canonical schema enforces what "the same answer"
        means.
