"""alpha-engine-config-I8701 — the two realized-IC producers answer the same
question off the same table, so they must scope the same rows.

`analysis/production_health.py::compute_production_health` gained the horizon
and post-cutover filters on 2026-05-15, after the false-positive
`ic_degradation` retrain alert of 2026-05-11 (rolling = -0.1005 against a
training IC of 0.4634). `pipeline_common.py::push_predictor_rolling_metrics`
answers the same question off the same table and NEVER received them — the
`fix-not-propagated-to-analogous-sites` class.

Measured 2026-08-26, off one weekly run, the two published values disagreed in
SIGN:

    predictor/metrics/latest.json           ic_30d          = -0.0768  (N=547)
    predictor/metrics/production_health.json rolling_30d_ic = +0.0321  (N=25)

and -0.0768 was the number rendered on the daily Alpha Engine Brief.

These tests are written to FAIL against the pre-fix `push_predictor_rolling_metrics`
(champion-challenger-policy §7.4 — a guard that cannot fail is worse than no
guard, because it reads as coverage).
