"""The replay Lambda deploys must strip denied environment variables, and
must do it where the promotion can carry the change to traffic.

alpha-engine-config-I7925. `alpha-engine-replay-concordance` and
`alpha-engine-replay-counterfactual` were two of eleven fleet-wide Lambdas
carrying a `GITHUB_TOKEN` set by hand and refreshed by nothing — the
environment is live-only state that no repo, IaC file or script here ever
wrote. The environment carried a STALE COPY of the credential — set
from an older SSM parameter version and never re-derived on deploy —
that GitHub rejected while the SSM parameter's own value remained valid
the whole time (alpha-engine-config-I7968 tracks the mis-attribution).
On 2026-08-21 a first-party
dependency picked it up out of site-packages, sent it to GitHub, got a 401,
and halted the preopen trading pipeline 3.4 seconds after start
(alpha-engine-config-I7924). `alpha-engine-predictor-inference`
(crucible-predictor) was the one of eleven that broke and was fixed first
(crucible-predictor-PR535).

I7925's own audit attributed these two functions to crucible-research.
Verified live: `infrastructure/deploy_concordance.sh` and `infrastructure/
deploy_counterfactual.sh`, in THIS repo, own and deploy them (ECR repo name,
LAMBDA_FUNCTION, IAM role, and the GHA deploy.yml matrix all name this
repo) — crucible-research's deploy.sh has no reference to either function.

Both scripts now converge the environment against a deny-list before
`publish-version`. These tests pin the two properties that make that
convergence real, because both fail SILENTLY: a removal placed after
`publish-version` never reaches the published version the `live` alias
serves (L4497), and a removal that also promotes the alias would race the
deploy's own promotion (Step 8/the final `update-alias` in each script).
