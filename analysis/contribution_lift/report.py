"""report.py — assembles the ``contribution_lift.json`` artifact.

Contract v1 (``contribution_lift_contract.md``), consumed by
``crucible-evaluator/grading/tiles/contribution_lift.py`` via the
``"contribution_lift": "contribution_lift.json"`` entry in
``grading/artifacts.py::ARTIFACT_MAP``.

Producer-side rules this module owns:

* ``red_line`` is 0.0 for every record and ``target`` is None — the producer
  never hand-sets a target; the evaluator resolves it through the T3
  thresholds registry (spec §3: an objective-CI-derived target, never a bare
  constant). Both live on the consumer side, so neither appears here.
* Status is never derived from ``sharpe_ratio``/Sortino while I7236 / I7237 /
  I7271 are open. ``dsr``/``psr`` ride along as diagnostics only.
* Always-emit: a ``skipped`` or ``error`` report is still a report. Absence of
  the S3 object must unambiguously mean "the producer never ran".
