"""research.research_composite — the research-tile substitution replays (config-I7478).

Five graded `crucible-evaluator/grading/tiles/research.py` components, all
answering the same question in the RC v3 objective (net-of-cost realized 21d
log-alpha vs SPY, spec §1): **how much of the measured alpha survives when this
component's ranking information is taken away?**

All five use the *substitution* pattern (spec §3): the arms differ only in WHICH
names were selected, never in how they were sized or costed, so the harness's
shared equal-weight sizing is exactly what isolates selection.

Coverage
--------

``research_composite_ic`` — **measured**. The live universe-board attractiveness
composite, rebuilt per cycle from the six sector-neutral pillar percentiles
persisted to ``factors/profiles/{date}/by_ticker.json``
(``quality_score``, ``value_score``, ``momentum_score``, ``growth_score``,
``stewardship_score``, ``low_vol_score``) by the exact blend
``analysis/end_to_end.py::_scanner_factor_counterfactual`` uses: cross-sectional
winsorized-z per pillar, clipped +/-3, then a coverage-renormalized equal-weight
row mean. The board's terminal cross-sectional percentile is a monotone
transform, so ranking on this blend IS ranking on the live
``attractiveness_score``.

* baseline — top-N by that composite, N = the live selection's width for the
  same cycle (``harness.live_picks_by_date``: the executed ENTERs in trades.db,
  champion-aware per config-I7501 — count-matched to the book the system
  actually opened).
* ablated  — **every pillar replaced by its own cross-sectional mean**. That is
  the leave-one-out for a *ranking* component: substituting each input by its
  cross-sectional mean collapses every winsorized-z to zero, so the composite
  becomes a constant and carries no ordering at all, while the universe, the
  cycle set, the width and the sizing are untouched. It is a substitution of the
  component's own inputs, not a different selector bolted on beside it.

  A constant score leaves the selection entirely to the tie-break, and the
  obvious tie-break — plain ascending ticker — is rejected here: it returns the
  SAME alphabetically-first names on every cycle, which is not an
  uninformative-selection null but one persistent concentrated portfolio whose
  per-cycle diffs are strongly correlated across cycles (understating the paired
  bootstrap's variance). The tie-break used instead is a **deterministic
  rotation** of the ticker-sorted universe, offset by the cycle's position in
  the window: still pure, still reproducible byte-for-byte, still ties-by-ticker
  within a cycle, but it walks the whole universe over the window so the null
  averages over the cross-section instead of betting on one corner of the
  alphabet. See :func:`_rotated_slice`.

``neutralization_live_efficacy`` — **measured**. The component is the
cross-sectional Barra residualizer (momentum/beta/size, config#1142); the
leave-one-out is to bypass it.

* baseline — top-N by the composite AFTER ``end_to_end._xs_neutralize`` against
  ``DEFAULT_NEUTRALIZE_FACTORS``, exposures loaded read-only from the ArcticDB
  universe feature history via ``end_to_end.load_historical_factor_loadings``.
* ablated  — top-N by the RAW composite (neutralization bypassed).

  Cycles where the residualizer passes through as the identity (its <20-name
  floor, or missing exposures) are dropped from both arms: on those cycles the
  two arms are the same portfolio and a 0.0 diff would be recorded as
  "neutralization contributes nothing" when the truth is that it never engaged.
  If NO cycle engages, the component reports ``N/A-MISSING-INPUT`` naming the
  exposure coverage rather than a zero.

``scanner_feed_counterfactual`` — **measured**. The component is the scanner's
ranking of the ~900-name PIT universe down to the passing pool.

* baseline — the live selection: the names actually entered that cycle
  (``harness.live_picks_by_date``, config-I7501).
* ablated  — the same count drawn from the **pre-scanner** PIT population
  (every ``scanner_evaluations`` row for the as-of research cycle, i.e. the
  names the scanner had in front of it) with its ranking removed, by the same
  deterministic rotation. ``scanner_evaluations`` is LIVE — it is written every
  research cycle and is not part of the retired research graph.

``sector_teams_avg`` and ``cio_selection_skill`` — **N/A-RETIRED**. Their only
sources are the six-team / CIO research-graph tables, retired 2026-07-12
(``analysis/end_to_end.RESEARCH_GRAPH_RETIRED_DATE``); the producer stopped
writing them and nothing has replaced their per-team / per-CIO selection
record. A replay reading them would measure a system that no longer exists, and
the package's own guard test forbids naming those tables in executable code.
There is no substitute selection to count-match against, so these emit an
explicit ``N/A-RETIRED`` with the retirement date rather than a fabricated
value.

Determinism
-----------
Every arm is a pure function of :class:`ReplayInputs` plus two read-only
archive reads (ArcticDB feature history for the exposures, the research SQLite
for the pre-scanner population). No RNG anywhere: the only non-score ordering
in this module is the ticker sort and the cycle-index rotation.
