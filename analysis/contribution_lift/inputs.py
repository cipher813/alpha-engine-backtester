"""inputs.py — the LIVE loader for the contribution-lift harness.

The two existing replay precedents in this repo — ``analysis/factor_blend_
counterfactual_replay.py`` and ``analysis/sector_constraint_replay.py`` — are
both default-OFF and take their cycles/price matrix as INJECTED config. Nothing
in the live weekly path ever injects them, so ``evaluate.py::_run_factor_blend_
counterfactual_replay`` is a guaranteed ``skipped`` on every Saturday run and
``sector_constraint_replay`` has zero live callers. A replay that never runs
measures nothing; the report card cannot be built on one.

This loader is therefore the deliberate departure: it assembles its OWN inputs
from the live archive, so ``contribution_lift`` runs on every weekly cycle
without an operator injecting anything.

Sources (all live as of 2026-08-17):

* ``trades.db`` (``trades WHERE action='ENTER'``) — the selection actually made
* ``s3://{bucket}/signals/{date}/signals.json``     — the per-cycle scored universe
* ``s3://{bucket}/predictor/predictions/{date}.json`` — the per-name alpha hats
* ``s3://{bucket}/factors/profiles/{date}/by_ticker.json`` — sub-factor pillars
* ArcticDB (via ``store.arctic_reader.load_universe_from_arctic``) — prices + SPY

The cycle axis is the **live selection's** dates, not the signals partitions'
(config-I7501). Entry selection left the signals producer on 2026-07-13 when
``scanner_predictor_direct`` became the champion, so ``signals.json`` carries a
scored universe but no ENTER rows; the executed record in ``trades.db`` is the
only feed that spans both eras, and it reaches back to 2026-04 where ``signals/``
holds ~58 partitions. Anchoring the window to it is what makes the harness's
60-cycle ``n_floor`` reachable at all.

Explicitly NOT an input: the retired six-team + CIO research-graph tables
(``team_candidates`` / ``cio_evaluations``, retired 2026-07-12 per
``analysis/end_to_end.RESEARCH_GRAPH_RETIRED_DATE``). A replay reading a
retired producer measures a system that no longer exists.
