"""harness.py — the shared contribution-lift replay harness (RC v3 T5).

Report Card v3 §1 fixes ONE objective for the whole system:

    objective(cycle) = log_return_21d(portfolio, net_of_cost) − log_return_21d(SPY)

and §3 replaces every declared component weight with a **measured marginal
contribution** to that objective: replay the pipeline twice — once as
configured (the *baseline* arm), once with the component ablated (the
*ablated* arm) — and report the paired per-cycle difference.

This module is the machinery every T5 group shares. A group contributes ONE
:class:`ReplaySpec` to ``registry.SPECS``; the spec's ``build_arms`` callable
turns the live :class:`ReplayInputs` into an :class:`ArmSet` (or a
:class:`NotAvailable` when its input does not exist), and everything after
that — sizing, simulation, the objective, the paired bootstrap CI, count
matching, DSR/PBO, the emitted component dict — happens here exactly once.

Two arm shapes are supported, because "removing" a component means two
different things (spec §3):

* **picks** — ``[{"date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "picks": ["AAPL", ...]}, ...]``.
  The harness applies its own deterministic equal-weight sizing and a fixed
  hold of ``horizon_days`` trading rows. This is the *substitution* pattern:
  research-side arms differ only in WHICH names were selected, so a shared,
  boring sizing rule is exactly what isolates selection from sizing.
* **orders** — an explicit ``[{"date", "ticker", "action", "shares",
  "price_at_order"}, ...]`` list. This is the *null_arm* pattern: an
  executor-side arm has to reproduce real fills and real sizes, because the
  thing being ablated (a guard, an exit rule, a sizer) acts ON those.

Both shapes go through the SAME cost-bearing simulator
(``vectorbt_bridge.orders_to_portfolio`` + ``portfolio_stats``) that
``backtest._run_simulation_loop`` uses, at the config's own ``fees`` /
``slippage_bps`` — a replay that skips the cost model is measuring a proxy,
not the objective (spec §1).

Determinism: no RNG anywhere except the bootstrap's fixed ``seed=0``; ties in
selection are broken by ticker ascending.
